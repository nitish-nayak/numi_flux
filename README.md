Fork of original NuMIFlux [repo](https://github.com/marcodeltutto/NuMIFlux), combined with Krishan's [modifications](https://github.com/kvjmistry/NuMIFlux) for dk2nu files

- Various simplifications as well
- Plan to improve some areas to ensure easy comparisons
- Currently, NuMIFlux.cc looks at FLUGG ntuples and Dk2NuFlux.cc looks at Dk2Nu ntuples
- Check RunNumiFlux.py and RunDk2NuFlux.py for usage
